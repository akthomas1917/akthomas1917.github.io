	<p> My name is Andrew Thomas and I'm a computer science major at Stony Brook University. <br> I've been programming for about four years now and mainly have experience with Java, <br> HTML, CSS, and some Python. In my classes, I mainly use object-oriented programming, <br> and outside of school, I've been teaching myself web development (which I used to code <br> this website), however my real interest is in cyber security (which I plan to specialize in my <br> junior year). As of now, I'm planning to pursue a Master's degree in computer science after <br> graduating from Stony Brook, but I'm <br> still considering other options as well.</p>

	<div class="bio2"
	<p> Outside of classes, my two biggest passions are sports and music. I've played trumpet <br> and piano for about 10 years now, and currently play in the Spirit of Stony Brook <br> Marching Band. I'm also a huge hip-hop/rap fan - some of my favorite artists  include <br> Logic, J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar, Childish Gambino, and many more. I like making my own <br>covers of my favorite songs using the skills I've learned in band (you can check out some <br> of my covers in the "Music" tab). I've also been a huge basketball fan from a young age <br> and love playing when I get the chance. My favorite team is the Celtics and my favorite <br>player is Kyrie Irving.</p>
